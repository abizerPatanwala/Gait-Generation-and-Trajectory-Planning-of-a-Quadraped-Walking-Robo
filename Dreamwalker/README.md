## Dreamwalker
Master's degree final project which included design, simulation and creating walking algorithms of quadruped robot.

### Story behind the project

As a master's degree student I majored in biomechanics and robotics. While being an overly ambitious person, I wished to make use of as many learned skills as possible during development of my master's final project. In addition I wanted to create an opportunity to push my Python programming skills to higher level. Then, inspired by Boston Dynamics' creations, I decided to make my own quadruped robot. Unfortunately I couldn't afford to build actual robot but, thanks to my thesis advisor's advice, I found out about possibility of making realisic simulation with use of Robot Operating System and Gazebo simulator. As a result I created simulation of my own quadruped robot and developed its movement control software.
